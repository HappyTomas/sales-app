# sales-app
Sale management system (SpringBoot, SpringSecurity, SpringDataJPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf/jQuery,  Maven)


This application is for my own purpose. I use to have a Google Sheet to manage sales, but As soon as I met Spring Framework I decided to migrate the sheet to a better application adding some new features to it.

I used my development skills to make things easy for me and people who work with me.

Backend is Java 8 with Spring framework, frontend is jQuery, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap and the data is stored in MySql database.
