# sales-app
Sale management system (SpringBoot, SpringSecurity, SpringDataJPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf/jQuery,  Maven)


This application was resquested by a customer. She used to have a Google Sheet to manage her sales, but we decided to migrate her sheet to a better application adding some new features to it, like email reports and balance chart.

I used my development skills to make things easy for her and people who work with her.

Backend is Java 8 with Spring framework, frontend is jQuery, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap and the data is stored in a MySql database.
